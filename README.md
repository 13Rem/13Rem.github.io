# *Chess have different valuable lessons that can relate in life.*

### `I'll share my favorite kinds of strategy in chess in order to win, and also i'll share some tips about chess too ;)`

## 1. `The Italian Game`

### This is my most favorite one, in order to Castle you'll need to make space for the King and Rook in order to Castle. This strategy will help you improve your opening or position.

## 2. `The Sicilian Najdorf`

### I learned this opening from one of Hikaru Nakamura's favorite opening. This Opening is for an aggressive opening.

## 3. `The King's Indian Defense`

### The reason for this is that many positions in the Kingâ€™s Indian Defense promise Black more active play than in most other openings. Black is able to avoid early simplifications and can enter unbalanced positions, which allows him to play for more than equality.
